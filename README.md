# BookBot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

BookBot allows you to run checks on text files (`.txt`).

It finds out:

- How many words are present in a file.
- The number of each character found in the file.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To start, run:

```bash
python3 main.py <path_to_file>
```
